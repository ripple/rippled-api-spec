        cancel_after:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Time, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch, of this channel's immutable expiration,
            if one was specified at channel creation. If this is before the close time of the
            most recent validated ledger, the channel is expired.
        channel_id:
          type: string
          description: >
            A unique ID for this channel, as a 64-character hexadecimal string.

        destination_account:
          type: string
          description: The destination account of the channel, as an Address. Only this account can receive the XRP in the channel while it is open.

            A 32-bit unsigned integer to use as a destination tag for payments through this channel,
            if one was specified at channel creation. This indicates the payment channel's beneficiary
            or other purpose at the destination account.
        expiration:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Time, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch, when this channel is set to expire.
            This expiration date is mutable. If this is before the close time of the most recent
            validated ledger, the channel is expired.
        public_key:
          type: string
          description: >
            The public key for the payment channel in the XRP Ledger's base58 format.
            Signed claims against this channel must be redeemed with the matching key pair.
        public_key_hex:
          type: string
          description: >
            The public key for the payment channel in hexadecimal format, if one was specified at channel creation.

          description: >
            A 32-bit unsigned integer to use as a source tag for payments through this payment channel,
            if one was specified at channel creation. This indicates the payment channel's originator or
            other purpose at the source account.
