# TODO:
# Simplify this repo to re-use specifications
# Most of the two api's are identical, they just need slightly different formats / keywords in:
# - This file in particular
# - And in the response types

# Conceptually unique things to prototype
# Requests / responses
# Subscriptions
# Submit request (As it will have transaction types as a requirement)

# TODO: (Preserved from original)
