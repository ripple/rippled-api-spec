        This transaction enables an account to hold an amount of a particular MPT issuance. When applied
        successfully, it creates a new MPToken object with an initial zero balance, owned by the holder account.

        If the issuer has set lsfMPTRequireAuth (allow-listing) on the MPTokenIssuance, the issuer must submit an
        MPTokenAuthorize transaction as well in order to give permission to the holder. If lsfMPTRequireAuth is not
        set and the issuer attempts to submit this transaction, it will fail.

              If set, and transaction is submitted by a holder, it indicates that the holder no longer wants to
              hold the MPToken, which will be deleted as a result. If the holder's MPToken has a non-zero balance
              while trying to set this flag, the transaction fails. On the other hand, if set, and transaction is
              submitted by an issuer, it would mean that the issuer wants to unauthorize the holder (only applicable
              for allow-listing), which would unset the lsfMPTAuthorized flag on the MPToken.
