(Transaction types such as AccountSet, SetRegularKey, SignerListSet, AccountDelete, DelegateSet, EnableAmendment, SetFee, and UNLModify cannot be delegated. Any newly added transaction should be assessed for delegatability and specified in transactions.macro.)

        - The PermissionDelegation amendment is not enabled.
        - The transaction was not validly specified. For example, the permission list contains duplicate values, or the Authorize field is the same as the Account field.
