        The XChainCommit is the second step in a cross-chain transfer. It puts assets into trust on the locking chain so that
        they can be wrapped on the issuing chain, or burns wrapped assets on the issuing chain so that they can be returned on the locking chain.

            The asset to commit, and the quantity. This must match the door account's LockingChainIssue (if on the locking chain)

            the XChainCreateClaimID transaction on the destination chain will need to submit a XChainClaim transaction to claim the funds.

            The unique integer ID for a cross-chain transfer. This must be acquired on the destination chain (via a XChainCreateClaimID
            transaction) and checked from a validated ledger before submitting this transaction. If an incorrect sequence number is
            specified, the funds will be lost.
