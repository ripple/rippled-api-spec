      x-enum-descriptions:
        - The TicketCount field is invalid. It must be an integer from 1 to 250.
        - This transaction would cause the account to own more than the limit of 250 Tickets at a time, or more than the maximum number of ledger objects in general.
        - The sending account does not have enough XRP to meet the owner reserve of all the requested Tickets.
