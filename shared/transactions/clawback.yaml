        Claw back tokens issued by your account.

        Clawback is disabled by default. To use clawback, you must send an AccountSet transaction to enable
        the Allow Trust Line Clawback setting. An issuer with any existing tokens cannot enable Clawback.
        You can only enable Allow Trust Line Clawback if you have a completely empty owner directory,
        meaning you must do so before you set up any trust lines, offers, escrows, payment channels,
        checks, or signer lists. After you enable Clawback, it cannot be reverted: the account permanently
        gains the ability to claw back issued assets on trust lines.

        Amount:

          description: |
            Indicates the amount being clawed back, as well as the counterparty from which the amount is
            being clawed back. The quantity to claw back, in the value sub-field, must not be zero. If this
            is more than the current balance, the transaction claws back the entire balance. The sub-field
            issuer within Amount represents the token holder's account ID, rather than the issuer's.
        Holder:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) Specifies the holder's address from which to claw back. The holder must already own
            an MPToken object with a non-zero balance. (Requires the MPToken amendment.)

      x-enum-descriptions:
        temDISABLED: Occurs if the Clawback amendment is not enabled.
        temBAD_AMOUNT: Occurs if the holder's balance is 0. It is not an error if the amount exceeds the holder's balance; in that case, the maximum available balance is clawed back. Also occurs if the counterparty listed in Amount is the same as the Account issuing this transaction.
        tecNO_LINE: Occurs if there is no trust line with the counterparty or that trust line's balance is 0.
        tecNO_PERMISSION: Occurs if you attempt to set lsfAllowTrustlineClawback while lsfNoFreeze is set. Also occurs, conversely, if you try to set lsfNoFreeze while lsfAllowTrustLineClawback is set.
