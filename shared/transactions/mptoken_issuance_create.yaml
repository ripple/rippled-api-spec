      description: |
        The MPTokenIssuanceCreate transaction creates an MPTokenIssuance object and adds it to the relevant
        directory node of the creator account. This transaction is the only opportunity an issuer has to
        specify any token fields that are defined as immutable (for example, MPT Flags).

        If the transaction is successful, the newly created token is owned by the account (the creator
        account) that executed the transaction.

        Whenever your query returns an MPTokenIssuance transaction response, there will always be an
        mpt_issuance_id field on the Transaction Metadata page.

      properties:
        AssetScale:
          type: integer
          format: uint8
          description: |
            (Optional) An asset scale is the difference, in orders of magnitude, between a standard unit
            and a corresponding fractional unit. More formally, the asset scale is a non-negative integer
            (0, 1, 2, â€¦) such that one standard unit equals 10^(-scale) of a corresponding fractional unit.
            If the fractional unit equals the standard unit, then the asset scale is 0. Note that this value
            is optional, and will default to 0 if not supplied.
        TransferFee:
          type: integer
          format: uint16
          description: |
            (Optional) The value specifies the fee to be charged by the issuer for secondary sales of the Token,
            if such sales are allowed. Valid values for this field are between 0 and 50,000 inclusive, allowing
            transfer rates of between 0.000% and 50.000% in increments of 0.001. The field must not be present
            if the tfMPTCanTransfer flag is not set. If it is, the transaction should fail and a fee should be claimed.
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 50000
        MaximumAmount:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) The maximum asset amount of this token that can ever be issued, as a base-10 number encoded
            as a string. The current default maximum limit is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (2^63-1). This limit may
            increase in the future. If an upper limit is required, you must specify this field.
        MPTokenMetadata:
          type: string
          pattern: '^[0-9A-Fa-f]*$'
          description: |
            Arbitrary metadata about this issuance, in hex format. The limit for this field is 1024 bytes.

      description: Enum representing flags for MPTokenIssuanceCreate transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        tfMPTCanLock: If set, indicates that the MPT can be locked both individually and globally. If not set, the MPT cannot be locked in any way.
        tfMPTRequireAuth: If set, indicates that individual holders must be authorized. This enables issuers to limit who can hold their assets.
        tfMPTCanEscrow: If set, indicates that individual holders can place their balances into an escrow.
        tfMPTCanTrade: If set, indicates that individual holders can trade their balances using the XRP Ledger DEX.
        tfMPTCanTransfer: If set, indicates that tokens can be transferred to other accounts that are not the issuer.
        tfMPTCanClawback: If set, indicates that the issuer can use the Clawback transaction to claw back value from individual holders.
