        Create a payment channel and fund it with XRP. The address sending this transaction becomes
        the "source address" of the payment channel.
      required:
        - Amount
        - Destination
        - SettleDelay
        - PublicKey
      properties:
        Amount:
          type: string
          description: |
            Amount of XRP, in drops, to deduct from the sender's balance and set aside in this channel.
            While the channel is open, the XRP can only go to the Destination address. When the channel closes,
            any unclaimed XRP is returned to the source address's balance.
        Destination:
          type: string
          description: |
            Address to receive XRP claims against this channel. This is also known as the "destination address"
            for the channel. Cannot be the same as the sender (Account).
        SettleDelay:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            Amount of time the source address must wait before closing the channel if it has unclaimed XRP.
        PublicKey:
          type: string
          description: |
            The 33-byte public key of the key pair the source will use to sign claims against this channel,
            in hexadecimal. This can be any secp256k1 or Ed25519 public key.
        CancelAfter:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) The time, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch, when this channel expires. Any transaction
            that would modify the channel after this time closes the channel without otherwise affecting it.
            This value is immutable; the channel can be closed earlier than this time but cannot remain open
            after this time.
        DestinationTag:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this payment channel, such as a
            hosted recipient at the destination address.
