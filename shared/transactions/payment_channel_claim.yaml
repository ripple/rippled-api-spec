        Claim XRP from a payment channel, adjust the payment channel's expiration, or both.

        This transaction can be used differently depending on the transaction sender's role in the specified channel:

        The source address of a channel can:
        - Send XRP from the channel to the destination with or without a signed Claim.
        - Set the channel to expire as soon as the channel's SettleDelay has passed.
        - Clear a pending Expiration time.
        - Close a channel immediately, with or without processing a claim first. The source address cannot close the channel immediately if the channel has XRP remaining.

        The destination address of a channel can:
        - Receive XRP from the channel using a signed Claim.
        - Close the channel immediately after processing a Claim, refunding any unclaimed XRP to the channel's source.

        Any address sending this transaction can:
        - Cause a channel to be closed if its Expiration or CancelAfter time is older than the previous ledger's close time. Any validly-formed PaymentChannelClaim transaction has this effect regardless of the contents of the transaction.

        - Clear the channel's Expiration time. Only the source address of the payment channel can use this flag.
        - Request to close the channel. Only the channel source and destination addresses can use this flag. This flag closes the channel immediately if it has no more XRP allocated after processing the current claim, or if the destination address uses it. If the source address uses this flag when the channel still holds XRP, this schedules the channel to close after SettleDelay seconds have passed.
