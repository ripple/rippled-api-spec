        - The transaction would create a preauthorization that already exists.
        - The sender would not meet the reserve requirement after adding another entry to the ledger. (A DepositPreauth entry counts as one item towards the authorizer's owner reserve.)
        - The transaction tried to revoke a preauthorization that does not exist in the ledger.
        - One or more specified credential issuers does not exist in the ledger.
        - The transaction tried to authorize an account that is not a funded account in the ledger.
        - The address in the Authorize field is the sender of the transaction. You cannot preauthorize yourself.
        - A required amendment is not enabled.
