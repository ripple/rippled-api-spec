        tecDUPLICATE: The transaction would create a preauthorization that already exists.
        tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE: The sender would not meet the reserve requirement after adding another entry to the ledger. (A DepositPreauth entry counts as one item towards the authorizer's owner reserve.)
        tecNO_ENTRY: The transaction tried to revoke a preauthorization that does not exist in the ledger.
        tecNO_ISSUER: One or more specified credential issuers does not exist in the ledger.
        tecNO_TARGET: The transaction tried to authorize an account that is not a funded account in the ledger.
        temCANNOT_PREAUTH_SELF: The address in the Authorize field is the sender of the transaction. You cannot preauthorize yourself.
        temDISABLED: A required amendment is not enabled.
