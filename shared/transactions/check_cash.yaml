        Attempts to redeem a Check object in the ledger to receive up to the amount authorized by the
        corresponding CheckCreate transaction. Only the Destination address of a Check can cash it with a
        CheckCash transaction. Cashing a check this way is similar to executing a Payment initiated by the
        destination.

        Since the funds for a check are not guaranteed, redeeming a Check can fail because the sender does
        not have a high enough balance or because there is not enough liquidity to deliver the funds. If
        this happens, the Check remains in the ledger and the destination can try to cash it again later,
        or for a different amount.

            (Optional) Redeem the Check for exactly this amount, if possible. The currency must match that
            of the SendMax of the corresponding CheckCreate transaction. You must provide either this field
            or DeliverMin.

          description: |
            (Optional) Redeem the Check for at least this amount and for as much as possible. The currency
            must match that of the SendMax of the corresponding CheckCreate transaction. You must provide
            either this field or Amount.

        tecNO_PERMISSION: If the sender of the CheckCash transaction is not the Destination of the check, the transaction fails.
        tecNO_ENTRY: If the Check identified by the CheckID field does not exist, the transaction fails.
        tecEXPIRED: If the Check identified by the CheckID field has already expired, the transaction fails.
        tecDST_TAG_NEEDED: If the destination of the Check has the RequireDest flag enabled but the Check, as created, does not have a destination tag, the transaction fails.
        temMALFORMED: If the transaction specifies both Amount and DeliverMin, or omits both, the transaction fails.
        temBAD_CURRENCY: If the Amount or DeliverMin does not match the currency (and issuer, if not XRP) of the Check, the transaction fails.
