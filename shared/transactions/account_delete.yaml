      x-enum-descriptions:
        - Occurs if the DeletableAccounts amendment is not enabled.
        - Occurs if the Destination matches the sender of the transaction (Account field).
        - Occurs if the Destination account requires a destination tag, but the DestinationTag field was not provided.
        - Occurs if the Destination account is not a funded account in the ledger.
        - Occurs if the Destination account requires deposit authorization and the sender is not preauthorized.
        - Occurs if the sender's Sequence number is too high. The transaction's Sequence number plus 256 must be less than the current Ledger Index. This prevents replay of old transactions if this account is resurrected after it is deleted.
        - Occurs if the account to be deleted is connected to objects that cannot be deleted in the ledger. (This includes objects created by other accounts, such as escrows and for example NFT's minted, even if owned by another account.)
        - Occurs if the sending account is linked to more than 1000 objects in the ledger. The transaction could succeed on retry if some of those objects were deleted separately first.
