        The XChainCreateBridge transaction creates a new Bridge ledger object and defines a new cross-chain bridge entrance
        on the chain that the transaction is submitted on. It includes information about door accounts and assets for the bridge.

        The transaction must be submitted first by the locking chain door account. To set up a valid bridge, door accounts on
        both chains must submit this transaction, in addition to setting up witness servers.

        The complete production-grade setup would also include a SignerListSet transaction on the two door accounts for the
        witnesses’ signing keys, as well as disabling the door accounts’ master key. This ensures that the witness servers
        are truly in control of the funds.
