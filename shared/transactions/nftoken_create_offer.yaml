        Creates either a new Sell offer for an NFToken owned by the account executing the transaction, or a new
        Buy offer for an NFToken owned by another account.

        If successful, the transaction creates an NFTokenOffer object. Each offer counts as one object towards
        the owner reserve of the account that placed the offer.
      required:
        - NFTokenID
        - Amount
      properties:
        Owner:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) Who owns the corresponding NFToken. If the offer is to buy a token, this field must be
            present and it must be different than the Account field (since an offer to buy a token one already
            holds is meaningless). If the offer is to sell a token, this field must not be present, as the owner
            is, implicitly, the same as the Account (since an offer to sell a token one doesn't already hold is meaningless).
        NFTokenID:
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the NFToken object that the offer references.
        Amount:
          $ref: '../base.yaml#/components/schemas/CurrencyAmount'
          description: |
            Indicates the amount expected or offered for the corresponding NFToken. The amount must be non-zero,
            except where this is an offer to sell and the asset is XRP; then, it is legal to specify an amount of zero,
            which means that the current owner of the token is giving it away, gratis, either to anyone at all, or to
            the account identified by the Destination field.
        Expiration:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) Time after which the offer is no longer active, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch.
        Destination:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) If present, indicates that this offer may only be accepted by the specified account.
            Attempts by other accounts to accept this offer MUST fail.

      description: Enum representing possible error codes for NFTokenCreateOffer transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        temDISABLED: The NonFungibleTokensV1 amendment is not enabled.
        temBAD_AMOUNT: The Amount field is not valid. For example, the amount was zero for a buy offer, or the amount is denominated in fungible tokens but the NFToken has the lsfOnlyXRP flag enabled.
        temBAD_EXPIRATION: The specified Expiration time is invalid (for example, 0).
        tecDIR_FULL: The sender already owns too many objects in the ledger, or there are already too many offers to buy or sell this token.
        tecEXPIRED: The specified Expiration time has already passed.
        tecFROZEN: The Amount is denominated in fungible tokens, but one of the trust lines that would receive tokens from this offer is frozen. This could be the seller's trust line or the NFToken's issuer's trust line (if the NFToken has a transfer fee).
        tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE: The sender does not have enough XRP to meet the reserve requirement after placing this offer.
        tecNO_DST: The account specified in the Destination field does not exist in the ledger.
        tecNO_ENTRY: The NFToken is not owned by the expected account.
        tecNO_ISSUER: The issuer specified in the Amount field does not exist.
        tecNO_LINE: The Amount field is denominated in fungible tokens, but the NFToken's issuer does not have a trust line for those tokens and the NFToken does not have the lsfTrustLine flag enabled.
        tecNO_PERMISSION: The Destination account blocks incoming NFTokenOffers. (Requires the DisallowIncoming amendment.)
        tecUNFUNDED_OFFER: For a buy offer, the sender does have the funds specified in the Amount field available. If the Amount is XRP, this could be due to the reserve requirement; if the Amount is denominated in fungible tokens, this could be because they are frozen.
        tefNFTOKEN_IS_NOT_TRANSFERABLE: The NFToken has the lsfTransferable flag disabled and this transaction would not transfer the NFToken to or from the issuer.
