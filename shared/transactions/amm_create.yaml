        Create a new Automated Market Maker (AMM) instance for trading a pair of assets (fungible tokens
        or XRP). Creates both an AMM entry and a special AccountRoot entry to represent the AMM. Also
        transfers ownership of the starting balance of both assets from the sender to the created
        AccountRoot and issues an initial balance of liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens) from the AMM
        account to the sender.

            (Required) The fee to charge for trades against this AMM instance, in units of 1/100,000; a
            value of 1 is equivalent to 0.001%. The maximum value is 1000, indicating a 1% fee. The
            minimum value is 0.

      description: Enum representing possible error codes for AMMCreate transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS: Either Amount or Amount2 has a currency code that is the same as this AMM's LP Tokens would use. (This is very unlikely to occur.)
        tecDUPLICATE: There is already another AMM for this currency pair.
        tecFROZEN: At least one of the deposit assets (Amount or Amount2) is currently frozen.
        tecINSUF_RESERVE_LINE: The sender of this transaction does meet the increased reserve requirement of processing this transaction, probably because they need a new trust line to hold the LP Tokens, and they don't have enough XRP to meet the additional owner reserve for a new trust line.
        tecNO_AUTH: At least one of the deposit assets uses authorized trust lines and the sender does not have authorization to hold that asset.
        tecNO_LINE: The sender does not have a trust line for at least one of the deposit assets.
        tecNO_PERMISSION: At least one of the deposit assets cannot be used in an AMM. For example, the issuer has enabled Clawback support.
        tecUNFUNDED_AMM: The sender does not hold enough of the assets specified in Amount and Amount2 to fund the AMM.
        terNO_RIPPLE: The issuer of at least one of the assets has not enabled the Default Ripple flag.
        temAMM_BAD_TOKENS: 'The values of Amount and Amount2 are not valid: for example, both refer to the same token.'
        temBAD_FEE: The TradingFee value is invalid. It must be zero or a positive integer and cannot be over 1000.
        temDISABLED: The AMM feature is not enabled on this network.
