        The NFTokenBurn transaction is used to remove a NFToken object from the NFTokenPage in which it is
        being held, effectively removing the token from the ledger (burning it).

        The sender of this transaction must be the owner of the NFToken to burn; or, if the NFToken has the
        lsfBurnable flag enabled, can be the issuer or the issuer's authorized NFTokenMinter account instead.

        If this operation succeeds, the corresponding NFToken is removed. If this operation empties the
        NFTokenPage holding the NFToken or results in consolidation, thus removing a NFTokenPage, the ownerâ€™s
        reserve requirement is reduced by one.

            (Optional) The owner of the NFToken to burn. Only used if that owner is different than the account
            sending this transaction. The issuer or authorized minter can use this field to burn NFTs that have
            the lsfBurnable flag enabled.
