        Sequester XRP until the escrow process either finishes or is canceled.
      required:
        - Amount
        - Destination
      properties:
        Amount:
          type: string
          description: |
            Amount of XRP, in drops, to deduct from the sender's balance and escrow. Once escrowed, the XRP
            can either go to the Destination address (after the FinishAfter time) or be returned to the
            sender (after the CancelAfter time).
        Destination:
          type: string
          description: |
            Address to receive escrowed XRP.
        CancelAfter:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) The time, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch, when this escrow expires. This value is
            immutable; the funds can only be returned to the sender after this time.
        FinishAfter:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) The time, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch, when the escrowed XRP can be released to
            the recipient. This value is immutable, and the funds can't be accessed until this time.
        Condition:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) Hex value representing a PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-condition. The funds can only be
            delivered to the recipient if this condition is fulfilled. If the condition is not fulfilled
            before the expiration time specified in the CancelAfter field, the XRP can only revert to the sender.
        DestinationTag:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this escrowed payment, such as a
            hosted recipient at the destination address.
