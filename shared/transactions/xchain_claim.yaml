        The XChainClaim transaction completes a cross-chain transfer of value. It allows a user to claim the value on the
        destination chain - the equivalent of the value locked on the source chain. A user can only claim the value if they
        own the cross-chain claim ID associated with the value locked on the source chain (the Account field). The user can
        send the funds to anyone (the Destination field). This transaction is only needed if an OtherChainDestination isn't
        specified in the XChainCommit transaction, or if something goes wrong with the automatic transfer of funds.

        If the transaction succeeds in moving funds, the referenced XChainOwnedClaimID ledger object will be destroyed.
        This prevents transaction replay. If the transaction fails, the XChainOwnedClaimID won't be destroyed and the
        transaction can be re-run with different parameters.
