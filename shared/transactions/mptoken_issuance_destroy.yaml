        The MPTokenIssuanceDestroy transaction is used to remove an MPTokenIssuance object from the directory
        node in which it is being held, effectively removing the token from the ledger ("destroying" it).

        If this operation succeeds, the corresponding MPTokenIssuance is removed and the ownerâ€™s reserve
        requirement is reduced by one. This operation must fail if there are any holders of the MPT in question.
