    AMMBidTransaction:
      description: |
        Bid on an Automated Market Maker's (AMM's) auction slot. If you win, you can trade against the AMM 
        at a discounted fee until you are outbid or 24 hours have passed. If you are outbid before 24 hours
        have passed, you are refunded part of the cost of your bid based on how much time remains. If the 
        AMM's trading fee is zero, you can still bid, but the auction slot provides no benefit unless the 
        trading fee changes.

        You bid using the AMM's LP Tokens; the amount of a winning bid is returned to the AMM, decreasing
        the outstanding balance of LP Tokens.

          description: |
            (Required) The definition for one of the assets in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object
            with currency and issuer fields (omit issuer for XRP).

            (Required) The definition for the other asset in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object
            with currency and issuer fields (omit issuer for XRP).

          $ref: '../base.yaml#/components/schemas/CurrencyAmount'
          description: |
            (Optional) Pay at least this amount for the slot. Setting this value higher makes it harder
            for others to outbid you. If omitted, pay the minimum necessary to win the bid.
        BidMax:
          $ref: '../base.yaml#/components/schemas/CurrencyAmount'
          description: |
            (Optional) Pay at most this amount for the slot. If the cost to win the bid is higher than this
            amount, the transaction fails. If omitted, pay as much as necessary to win the bid.

            (Optional) A list of up to 4 additional accounts that you allow to trade at the discounted fee.
            This cannot include the address of the transaction sender. Each of these objects should be an
            Auth Account object.

        tecAMM_EMPTY: The AMM has no assets in its pool. In this state, you can only delete the AMM or fund it with a new deposit.
        tecAMM_FAILED: This transaction could not win the auction, either because the sender does not hold enough LP Tokens to pay the necessary bid or because the price to win the auction was higher than the transaction's specified BidMax value.
        tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS: The sender of this transaction does not hold enough LP Tokens to meet the slot price.
        temBAD_AMM_TOKENS: The specified BidMin or BidMax were not specified as the correct LP Tokens for this AMM.
        temDISABLED: The AMM feature is not enabled on this network.
        temMALFORMED: The transaction specified invalid options, such as a list of AuthAccounts that is too long.
        terNO_ACCOUNT: One of the accounts specified in this request do not exist.
        terNO_AMM: The Automated Market Maker instance for the asset pair in this transaction does not exist.
