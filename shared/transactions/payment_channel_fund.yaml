        Add additional XRP to an open payment channel, and optionally update the expiration time of the channel.
        Only the source address of the channel can use this transaction.

        Channel:
          type: string
          description: |
            The unique ID of the channel to fund, as a 64-character hexadecimal string.
        Amount:
          type: string
          description: |
            Amount of XRP, in drops, to add to the channel. Must be a positive amount of XRP.

            amountGreaterThan: 0
        Expiration:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) New Expiration time to set for the channel, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch.
            This must be later than either the current time plus the SettleDelay of the channel, or the
            existing Expiration of the channel. After the Expiration time, any transaction that would access
            the channel closes the channel without taking its normal action. Any unspent XRP is returned to
            the source address when the channel closes.

        - The sending account has less XRP than the reserve requirement.
        - The destination account of the channel has been deleted. This is only possible if the payment channel was created before the fixPayChanRecipientOwnerDir amendment became enabled (on 2020-05-01).
        - The Payment Channel identified by the Channel field does not exist.
        - The sender of the transaction is not the source address for the channel.
        - The sending account does not have enough XRP to fund the channel with the requested amount and still meet the reserve requirement.
        - The Amount field of the transaction is invalid. The amount must be XRP and it cannot be zero or negative.
        - The Expiration field is invalid.
