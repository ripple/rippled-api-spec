        Deposit funds into an Automated Market Maker (AMM) instance and receive the AMM's liquidity
        provider tokens (LP Tokens) in exchange. You can deposit one or both of the assets in the AMM's
        pool.

        If successful, this transaction creates a trust line to the AMM Account (limit 0) to hold the
        LP Tokens.

      description: Enum representing flags for AMMDeposit transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        tfLPToken: Deposit both of this AMM's assets, in amounts calculated so that you receive the specified amount of LP Tokens in return. The amounts deposited maintain the relative proportions of the two assets the AMM already holds.
        tfTwoAsset: Deposit both of this AMM's assets, up to the specified amounts. The actual amounts deposited must maintain the same balance of assets as the AMM already holds, so the amount of either one deposited MAY be less than specified. The amount of LP Tokens you get in return is based on the total value deposited.
        tfTwoAssetIfEmpty: Deposit both of this AMM's assets, in exactly the specified amounts, to an AMM with an empty asset pool. The amount of LP Tokens you get in return is based on the total value deposited.
        tfSingleAsset: Deposit exactly the specified amount of one asset, and receive an amount of LP Tokens based on the resulting share of the pool (minus fees).
        tfOneAssetLPToken: Deposit up to the specified amount of one asset, so that you receive exactly the specified amount of LP Tokens in return (after fees).
        tfLimitLPToken: Deposit up to the specified amount of one asset, but pay no more than the specified effective price per LP Token (after fees).

        - terNO_AMM
      x-enum-descriptions:
        tecAMM_EMPTY: The AMM currently holds no assets, so you cannot do a normal deposit. You must use the Empty AMM Special Case deposit instead.
        tecAMM_NOT_EMPTY: The transaction specified tfTwoAssetIfEmpty, but the AMM was not empty.
        tecAMM_FAILED: The conditions on the deposit could not be satisfied. For example, the requested effective price in the EPrice field is too low.
        tecFROZEN: The transaction tried to deposit a frozen token.
        tecINSUF_RESERVE_LINE: The sender of this transaction does meet the increased reserve requirement of processing this transaction, probably because they need a new trust line to hold the LP Tokens, and they don't have enough XRP to meet the additional owner reserve for a new trust line.
        tecUNFUNDED_AMM: The sender does not have a high enough balance to make the specified deposit.
        temBAD_AMM_TOKENS: The transaction specified the LP Tokens incorrectly. For example, the issuer is not the AMM's associated AccountRoot address or the currency is not the currency code for this AMM's LP Tokens, or the transaction specified this AMM's LP Tokens in one of the asset fields.
        temBAD_AMOUNT: An amount specified in the transaction is invalid. For example, a deposit amount is negative.
        temBAD_FEE: A fee value specified in the transaction is invalid. For example, the trading fee is outside the allowable range.
        temMALFORMED: The transaction specified an invalid combination of fields. See AMMDeposit Modes.
        terNO_ACCOUNT: An account specified in the request does not exist.
        terNO_AMM: The Automated Market Maker instance for the asset pair in this transaction does not exist.
