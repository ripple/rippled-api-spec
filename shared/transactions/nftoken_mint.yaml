      type: object
      description: |
        The NFTokenMint transaction creates a non-fungible token and adds it to the relevant NFTokenPage
        object of the NFTokenMinter as an NFToken object. This transaction is the only opportunity the
        NFTokenMinter has to specify any token fields that are defined as immutable (for example, the TokenFlags).
      required:
        - NFTokenTaxon
      properties:
        NFTokenTaxon:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            An arbitrary taxon, or shared identifier, for a series or collection of related NFTs. To mint a
            series of NFTs, give them all the same taxon.
        Issuer:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) The issuer of the token, if the sender of the account is issuing it on behalf of another
            account. This field must be omitted if the account sending the transaction is the issuer of the NFToken.
            If provided, the issuer's AccountRoot object must have the NFTokenMinter field set to the sender of this
            transaction (this transaction's Account field).
        TransferFee:
          type: integer
          format: uint16
          description: |
            (Optional) The value specifies the fee charged by the issuer for secondary sales of the NFToken,
            if such sales are allowed. Valid values for this field are between 0 and 50000 inclusive, allowing
            transfer rates of between 0.00% and 50.00% in increments of 0.001. If this field is provided, the
            transaction MUST have the tfTransferable flag enabled.
          maximum: 50000
        URI:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) Up to 256 bytes of arbitrary data. In JSON, this should be encoded as a string of hexadecimal.
            This is intended to be a URI that points to the data or metadata associated with the NFT.
          maxLength: 512
        Amount:
          type: object
          description: |
            (Optional) Indicates the amount expected or offered for the corresponding NFToken. The amount must be
            non-zero, except where the asset is XRP; then, it is legal to specify an amount of zero.
        Expiration:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            (Optional) Time after which the offer is no longer active, in seconds since the Ripple Epoch.
            Results in an error if the Amount field is not specified.
        Destination:
          type: string
          description: |
            (Optional) If present, indicates that this offer may only be accepted by the specified account.
            Attempts by other accounts to accept this offer MUST fail. Results in an error if the Amount field
            is not specified.
        Flags:
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          description: |
            Flags modifying the behavior of the transaction. See NFTokenMintFlag for details.

        - tfTransferable: 0x00000008
      description: Enum representing flags for NFTokenMint transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        tfBurnable: Allow the issuer (or an entity authorized by the issuer) to destroy the minted NFToken. (The NFToken's owner can always do so.)
        tfOnlyXRP: The minted NFToken can only be bought or sold for XRP.
        tfTrustLine: DEPRECATED Automatically create trust lines from the issuer to hold transfer fees received from transferring the minted NFToken. The fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine amendment makes it invalid to set this flag.
        tfTransferable: The minted NFToken can be transferred to others. If this flag is not enabled, the token can still be transferred from or to the issuer, but a transfer to the issuer must be made based on a buy offer from the issuer and not a sell offer from the NFT holder.
    NFTokenMintErrorCode:
      $id: NFTokenMintErrorCode
      type: string
      enum:

        - tecMAX_SEQUENCE_REACHED
      description: Enum representing possible error codes for NFTokenMint transactions.
      x-enum-descriptions:
        temDISABLED: The NonFungibleTokensV1 amendment is not enabled.
        temBAD_NFTOKEN_TRANSFER_FEE: The TransferFee is not within the acceptable range.
        temINVALID_FLAG: The Flags value has bits enabled that are not allowed or valid flags. If the fixRemoveNFTokenAutoTrustLine amendment is enabled, the tfTrustLine flag causes this error.
        temMALFORMED: The transaction was not validly specified. For example, the URI field is longer than 256 bytes.
        tecNO_ISSUER: The Issuer refers to an account that does not exist in the ledger.
        tecNO_PERMISSION: The account referenced by the Issuer field has not authorized this transaction's sender (using the NFTokenMinter setting) to mint on their behalf.
        tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE: The owner would not meet the updated reserve requirement after minting the token.
        tecMAX_SEQUENCE_REACHED: The Issuer's MintedNFTokens field is already at its maximum. This is only possible if 2^32-1 NFTokens have been minted in total by the issuer or on their behalf.
